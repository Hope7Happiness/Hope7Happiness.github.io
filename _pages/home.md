# About Me

I am an undergraduate student in MIT Class of 2028. I am majoring in Physics, but I am also interested in AI.

Having taken a preparatory year at IIIS, Tsinghua University (also known as the Yao Class), I built foundation in Machine Learning and Deep Learning as well as proficiency in PyTorch. During this time, I also developed a solid understanding of the mathematical foundations related to computer science and artificial intelligence.

Although I am just a beginner in ML research, I have much passion in this field, and am eager to gain more experience. My resume is linked [here](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

## Projects

- [**Knowledge Database**](https://github.com/Hidden-Hyperparameter/llm_project)

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">This is the project for the course <i>Introduction to Large Language Model Application</i> at IIIS, Tsinghua University. In the project, we apply LLMs to answer user questions given a folder containing documents as the context. We developed a tagging system, which make the search efficient even when the number of documents is large. We also support semantic search for multimodal documents, such as images and videos.</p>

- [**Deep Learning Study**](https://github.com/Hidden-Hyperparameter/DeepLearning)

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">In the repository, I tried to implement some classic and modern deep learning models from scratch. Instead of using extensive tricks and hyperparameter tuning, I tried to make each model implementation simple and easy to follow while giving reasonable results. I also tried to analyze what tricks are the most necessary for the model to work, so that I can find out the problem more quickly when a new model doesn't work as expected.
    <br><br>
    The repository is still under construction, and I will keep updating it with more models and analysis.</p>
